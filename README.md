## Building SVR.JS

To build SVR.JS, you need Node.JS 18.0.0 or newer.

Before building SVR.JS, install the npm packages using this command:
```bash
npm install
```
After installing the packages, build SVR.JS with this command:
```bash
npm run build 
```
After running the command, you will get bundled SVR.JS script, around with built-in utilities and assets in the `dist` directory. You will also get a zip archive in `out` directory, that can be installed using SVR.JS installer

## Installation (built from source)

To install SVR.JS you just built from the source code, you can install it via SVR.JS installer for GNU/Linux or manually.

If you want to install SVR.JS manually, you can read the [server documentation](https://svrjs.org/docs/tentative).

If you want to install via SVR.JS installer for GNU/Linux, run this command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://downloads.svrjs.org/installer/svr.js.installer.linux.20240509.sh > /tmp/installer.sh && sudo bash /tmp/installer.sh
```

You will be then prompted about the type of installation. Choose option “2” to install SVR.JS from the zip archive, and type in the path to the zip archive (hint: it is in the `out` directory).

After typing the path, you may be prompted to install dependencies via GNU/Linux distribution’s package manager. Proceed with the installation of dependencies.

After installation, SVR.JS should be listening at http://localhost.

## SVR.JS documentation

You can read the [SVR.JS documentation](https://svrjs.org/docs/tentative) to get information on how to use SVR.JS.

## npm scripts

- To build SVR.JS along with the zip archive, run `npm run build`.
- To check SVR.JS code for errors with ESLint, run `npm run lint`.
- To fix and beautify SVR.JS code with ESLint and Prettier, run `npm run lint:fix`.
- To run SVR.JS from the "dist" folder, run `npm start`.
- To test SVR.JS itself, run `npm run dev`. This removes existing configuration.
- To perform unit tests with Jest, run `npm test`.

## File structure

The file structure for SVR.JS source code looks like this:
 - .husky - Git hooks
 - assets - files to copy into dist folder and to the archive
 - dist - contains SVR.JS, assets, and SVR.JS utiltiies
 - generatedAssets - assets generated by the build script
 - out - contains SVR.JS zip archive
 - src - contains SVR.JS source code
   - index.js - entry point
   - handlers - handlers for servers
   - middleware - built-in middleware for servers
   - res - resources
   - utils - utility functions
 - templates - EJS templates for build script to use
 - tests - Jest unit tests
   - middleware - tests for middleware
   - utils - unit tests for utility functions
 - utils - SVR.JS utilities (each utility has a single file)
 - commitlint.config.js - commitlint configuration
 - esbuild.config.js - the build script
 - eslint.config.js - ESLint configuration
 - jest.config.js - Jest configuration
 - lint-staged.config.js - lint-staged configuration
 - prettier.config.js - Prettier configuration
 - svrjs.json - SVR.JS version, name, documentation URL, and statistics server collection endpoint URL
