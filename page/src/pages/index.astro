        Welcome to our website! We're excited to have you here. However, please
        note that this is a newly installed web server, and there might be some
        issues or missing content as we continue to set things up.

      <h3>Website setup and configuration</h3>
      <p>
        Now that SVR.JS is installed, you can start setting up your website.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Edit the server configuration file</strong> &mdash; this file can
          be found either in <code>svrjs.yaml</code> in the SVR.JS installation directory,
          or in <code>/etc/svrjs.yaml</code> if you have installed SVR.JS via the
          SVR.JS installer for GNU/Linux. Alternatively, you can remove the <code
            >svrjs.yaml</code
          > file and instead use <code>config.json</code> file in the SVR.JS installation
          directory for configuring SVR.JS.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Replace the default page with contents of the website.</strong
          > &mdash; you can find the root of the website either in <code
            >wwwroot</code
          > in the SVR.JS installation directory, or in <code
            >/var/www/svrjs</code
          > if you have installed SVR.JS via the SVR.JS installer for GNU/Linux.
        </li>
      </ol>
